This caramel apple pie is a very sweet two crust pie filled with
caramel and apples. The homemade pie crust should be prepared
beforehand. If making in a large pan such as a 13x9 rather than
a smaller pie tin, double the recipe.

For the crust you'll need:

* 2c (480ml) flour
* 1/2c (120ml) cold water
* 1/2c (120ml) butter (softened, diced)
* 1/2c (120ml) shortening (diced)

Preparation:

. Mix together ingredients in a bowl until slightly doughy and still damp
. Roll mixture separate mixture into two halves
. Wrap each half in plastic or in a ziplock bag
. Refrigerate overnight

For the pie filling you'll need:

* 6-8 apples, a mix of Granny Smith and sweeter apples such as Fuji work best
* 1/2c (120ml)brown sugar
* 1tbsp (15 ml) cinnamon
* 1 bag soft caramel candies
* 1tbsp (15 ml) butter

Preparation:

. Pre-heat over to 350F/180C
. Remove pie crust from fridge
. Roll out one pie crust on a floured rolling mat to size of baking pan
. Place rolled crust in pie pan
. Roll out second pie crust, leave on rolling mat for now
. Start water in double boiler
. Unwrap caramel candies and set aside in bowl
. Add butter and caramel candies to double boiler,
  stir occasionally while performing other prep work
. Peel, core, and slice apples. This is done most easily 
  with a hand cranked apple peeler. Put apple slices into bowl.
. Mix brown sugar and cinnamon into apples. Thoroughly mix with clean hands or spoon.
. Layer apple slices into pie pan on to of bottom crust
. Once caramel is fully melted, drizzle over apple slices
. Apply top crust to pie, crimping edges with fingers or fork
. Bake pie in oven for 1 hour
. Remove pie and let sit for at least 1 hour before serving
