==== Writing

These release notes are written in the AsciiDoc (`*.adoc`) format. For some
great AsciiDoc documentation, see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/.

Viewing asciidoc is most easily done via a plugin to Chrome such as
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia

Add your recipe under recipes/<recipe-type> ... desserts go under recipes/desserts for example

Images associated with the recipe should be added under the images folder at the top level, then
inside a sub-folder with the recipe name
