Aunt Val's Mac & Cheese is an old family recipe that my wifes
sister gets credit for, but we believe it originated a generation
or two earlier. Super creamy and incredibly rich, a little bit
of this Mac will go a long way! For smaller groups consider
halving this recipe, as it makes a lot!

For the Mac you'll need:

* 16oz (450g) box of macaroni noodles
* 2 eggs lightly beaten
* 4c (960ml) cottage cheese
* 16oz (450g) plain yogurt
* 1/4tsp (1.25ml) salt
* 1/2tsp (2.5ml) pepper
* 4c (960ml) shredded Velveeta

Preparation:

. Consider freezing the Velveeta for 2-4 hours before shredding. Longer freeze times may make it too hard, but at fridge temps its a mess to shred
. Pre-heat oven to 350F (180C)
. Cook the macaroni noodles according to directions on box, drain
. Combine warm noodles, shredded Velveeta and all other ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly
. Place mixture into 13x9 or similar baking pan (or 8x8 for half recipe)
. Sprinkle topping (steps below) on top
. Bake for 30 minutes

For the topping you'll need:

* 1/2c (120ml) breadcrumbs
* 1.5tbsp (22ml) butter

Preparation:

. Melt butter
. Combine melted butter with breadcrumps, stir thoroughly with fork
. Sprinkle over top of noodle mixture per instructions above
